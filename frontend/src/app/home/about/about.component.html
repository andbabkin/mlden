        <p>Hi, I'm Andrei Babkin, self-employed software developer from Estonia,
          who converts amazing ideas into working applications.
          I'm equally comfortable working with a team or flying solo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last time I was working hard with Web apps and became familiar
          with following front- and back-end frameworks: Vue.js, Angular 6, Bootstrap 3-4, and Laravel 5.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to being able to develop Web Applications, I have also an experience
          in developing Information Systems, Android Games,
          and have a lot of time spent while creating different Excel VBA tools.
          So, feel free to contact me if you need my participation in your project.
        </p>
